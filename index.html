            Stock Predictor Program

            <div class="description">
                This program utilizes a basic Javascript, HTML, CSS front end. And ties to a Python Flask API backend that is hosted on a different site. The backend has a machine learning model that will take data from the stock given back to 2010. Then it will use this data to predict whether the stock will go up or down the next day the market is open. Give the program 30 seconds to a minute to print out the result.  (Disclaimer: DO NOT USE THIS MODEL FOR ACTUAL INVESTING ADVICE)
