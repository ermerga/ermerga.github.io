            Stock Predictor Program

            <div class="description">
                This program utilizes a basic Javascript, HTML, CSS front end. And ties to a Python Flask API backend that is hosted on a different site. The backend has a machine learning model that will take data from the stock given back to 1990. Then it will use this data to predict whether the stock will go up or down the next day the market is open. The backend is running on the free version so after one or two requests it will error. Give it a few minutes and it will work again.  (Disclaimer: DO NOT USE THIS MODEL FOR ACTUAL INVESTING ADVICE)
